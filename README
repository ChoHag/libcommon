libcommon

Library of functions for writing robust shell scripts.

This library includes extensive documentation because my idiot boss was
worried that other unix sysadmins might not understand shell scripts.

Put it in your $PATH (it doesn't need to be executable) and include it
at the top of your script with:

. libcommon

Includes:
  Simple terminal output formatting (assumes the terminal is 'normal')
  Logging, to stdout and/or syslog
  Locking
  Wrapper around trap "..." EXIT
