Library of functions for writing robust shell scripts.

The script includes extensive documentation because my idiot boss was
worried that other unix sysadmins might not understand shell scripts.

Includes:
  Simple terminal output formatting (assumes the terminal is 'normal')
  Logging, to stdout and/or syslog
  Locking
  Wrapper around trap "..." EXIT
